      "recommendation": "Incorporate a Limitation of Liability clause that caps the total liability of each party, ideally to the value of the contract or a mutually agreed-upon sum, with carve-outs for gross negligence, willful misconduct, and confidentiality breaches.",

      "description": "The contract does not specify who owns the intellectual property (IP) developed or utilized during the performance of the services. For QDB to benefit fully, it should own the deliverables.",

      "description": "The agreement lacks an indemnification clause, which would typically require one party to compensate the other for specific losses or damages, such as third-party claims arising from the indemnifying party's actions or omissions.",
      "recommendation": "Include an indemnification clause where Vendor Inc. agrees to indemnify and hold harmless QDB against any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, and expenses arising from Vendor Inc.'s breach of contract, negligence, or infringement of third-party rights.",
